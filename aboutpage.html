We do this by designing campaigns that make environmental actions desirable. We disrupt the status quo to raise awareness, nudge behaviours and shape systems. We do this with knowledge and playfulness, and we won’t make you feel bad. Design By Nature, brought to you by Hubbub, is an initiative that challenges students to find new ways to tackle environmental issues affecting our day-to-day lives. We celebrate innovation, creativity, disruptive thinking, collaboration and insight-led ideas that make sustainable living second nature.</div>
